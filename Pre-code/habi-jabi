Calculate Day from date
F=k+ [(13*m-1)/5] +D+ [D/4] +[C/4]-2*C where
k is  the day of the month.
m is the month number.
D is the last two digits of the year.
C is the first two digits of the year.
March is 1, April is 2â€¦.. January is 11 and February is 12.
So the year starts from March and ends with February. So if the given date has month as January or February subtract 1 from the year
